I've been using TypeScript for about three years now and I love it. The syntax is familiar and easy to read, but it adds some cool new features that make your life easier as well. In this article, I'll explain why I use TypeScript instead of Vanilla JS and how you can start using it today!

## If you know Javascript, you already know TypeScript

The gist of it is that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. What does this mean? This means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. If you know JavaScript, you already know the basics of TypeScript.

## Why use types at all?

If you have been using vanilla JS for a while and are familiar with it, it might not seem very interesting to learn something new. Most people probably don't see the need to use typings when vanilla JS gets the job done. But there are some things that vanilla JS can't do out of the box and this is where TypeScript comes in.

TypeScript has more features than JavaScript which makes it an attractive option for many developers who want their codebase to be as safe as possible or just want greater control over their project's overall structure and organization.

One thing I love about TypeScript is that it ensures type-safety for JavaScript at build-time as opposed to run-time. This means the code will be much more robust because it has been checked for errors before being compiled into JavaScript files, which are then executed in a browser environment.

## What does TypeScript enable you to do?

Type hinting is a feature of the ECMAScript language that allows you to declare what your variables are going to be used for. This is especially useful when you want the compiler or IDE to help with code completion, as it’s easier for them to know what you mean by something if they can see it at the beginning of your statement.

Intellisense in code editors is another great thing about TypeScript because it gives developers more information about their code at runtime than with other languages like JavaScript (or even vanilla). It also allows them to use tools like Find and Replace without having any knowledge of how those tools work—just by selecting text from within their editor! This makes working on large projects much simpler because refactoring becomes so much easier than using other languages that don't have this kind of support built into their implementations; but there's still plenty left over after all these benefits are taken into consideration--especially since they're free!

Finally, it's so much easier to spin up a new TypeScript project today than ever before. It integrates with other frameworks and tools very easily. You can use the same configuration file to build your app in Webstorm or Visual Studio Code, which means no more copying and pasting settings into different versions of IntelliJ IDEA or Webstorm.

TypeScript also has great support for configuring external libraries within your application as well as its compiler options; there are even libraries that allow you to write unit tests using ES6 classes (which I'm certainly not going to complain about). If you're looking for an easy way to get started with JS in general but aren't ready yet for React or VueJS then TypeScript is worth checking out!

## Final Words

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and it's been designed from the ground up with productivity in mind. It makes it easy for me to write more maintainable code, especially when I'm working with legacy technologies like Node.js. TypeScript helps me keep my code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), which is one of the most important aspects of writing good software. And finally, TypeScript is so much easier today than ever before!
